# RAG Chatbot - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objective
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that provides accurate, contextual answers to user queries based on a provided knowledge base. The system is designed to demonstrate fundamental skills in RAG implementation, LLM integration, and basic problem-solving capabilities.

### 1.2 Target Audience
Primary school students requiring age-appropriate communication with simple, clear, and engaging language.

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Achieve RAGAS evaluation scores above 80% across all key metrics
- Provide accurate, grounded responses within knowledge base scope
- Maintain appropriate tone for young learners
- Optional: Support multilingual interactions

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core RAG Implementation

#### 2.1.1 Knowledge Base Processing
- **Input**: PDF format knowledge base
- **Processing**: Extract, chunk, and index content for retrieval
- **Storage**: Maintain searchable vector embeddings

#### 2.1.2 Embedding-Based Retrieval
- Implement semantic search using vector embeddings
- Retrieve relevant context chunks for user queries
- Optimize retrieval accuracy and relevance

#### 2.1.3 Response Generation
- Integrate pre-trained language model (OpenAI API or equivalent)
- Generate responses using retrieved context
- Ensure factual accuracy and groundedness

### 2.2 Answer Quality & Scope Management

#### 2.2.1 In-Scope Responses
- Provide accurate answers based on knowledge base content
- Maintain factual consistency with source material
- Include relevant context and examples when appropriate

#### 2.2.2 Out-of-Scope Handling
- Detect queries outside knowledge base scope
- Respond with standardized message: "I'm not sure how to answer that based on the information I have."
- Avoid hallucination or speculation beyond provided content

### 2.3 Tone Adaptation
- **Language Level**: Appropriate for primary school students (ages 6-12)
- **Communication Style**: 
  - Simple vocabulary and sentence structure
  - Clear and direct explanations
  - Engaging and friendly tone
  - Age-appropriate examples and analogies

### 2.4 Multilingual Support (Optional)
- **Input Languages**: Accept queries in Mandarin, Malay, or other specified languages
- **Translation Pipeline**: 
  - Translate input query to English for KB search
  - Process using English knowledge base
  - Translate response back to original query language
- **Language Detection**: Automatic identification of input language

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: User interface for chat interactions
- **Backend**: RAG processing engine with API endpoints
- **Vector Database**: Embedding storage and retrieval system
- **LLM Integration**: Connection to language model service

### 3.2 Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 5 seconds for typical queries
- **Accuracy**: Maintain high factual consistency
- **Scalability**: Support multiple concurrent users

### 3.3 Integration Requirements

#### 4.1.2 Answer Relevancy  
- Evaluate how well responses address the specific user query
- Measure appropriateness and directness of answers

#### 4.1.3 Context Precision
- Assess accuracy of retrieved context chunks
- Measure relevance of selected knowledge base sections

#### 4.1.4 Context Recall
- Evaluate completeness of context retrieval
- Ensure all relevant information is captured for response generation

### 4.2 Additional Quality Metrics
- **User Experience**: Age-appropriate communication assessment
- **Scope Adherence**: Accuracy of in/out-of-scope detection
- **Multilingual Accuracy**: Translation quality and consistency (if implemented)
